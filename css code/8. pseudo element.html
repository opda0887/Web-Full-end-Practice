    <h1>What is Personalized Medicine?</h1>
    <p>
      Personalized medicine, also referred to as precision medicine, is a medical model that 
      separates people into different groupsâ€”with medical decisions, practices, interventions and/or 
      products being tailored to the individual patient based on their predicted response or risk of disease.

    <h1>Its method</h1>
    <p>
      In order for physicians to know if a mutation is connected to a certain disease, researchers often do 
      a study called a "genome-wide association study" (GWAS). A GWAS study will look at one disease, and then 
      sequence the genome of many patients with that particular disease to look for shared mutations in the genome.
